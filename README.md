# Unbrel

For anyone who wants to run a serious LN node, with a less beautiful interface but instead:
- Up-to-date components
- Only necessary containers
- More control over your node in general.

This repository should allow anyone to move away from Umbrel after updating to version 0.5.0. It only uses the bare minimum (tor, bitcoind, LND) but you can optionally run RTL, Thunderhub and/or bos.

**NOTE**: Still a work in progress (tor, bitcoind, LND), only the bare minimum is tested and working. 

If you stay at bitcoin-core v22, you can probably switch back to Umbrel if you would want to.
